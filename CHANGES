Sastre 0.34 [Jan 9, 2019]
==========================

Enhancements:
    - Validated support for vManage 19.3 and included new API endpoints supporting device access policies.
    - Included vManage version check. A warning is displayed during restore task if the vManage version on backup is
      newer than the version on target vManage. Maintenance releases (i.e. 3rd digit in the version number) are ignored
      for the purpose of this verification.


Sastre 0.33 [Dec 6, 2019]
==========================

Enhancements:
    - Sastre is now published to PyPI as cisco-sdwan package. When installed via pip, sdwan or sastre can be used to
      run the application.
    - When installed via source on github, the application can now be called using sdwan.py or sastre.py.


Sastre 0.31 [Nov 18, 2019]
==========================

Enhancements:
    - Template attach and reattach functions now support CLI templates. This means that restore --attach and --force
      options now support CLI templates in addition to feature-based device templates.
    - Added --regex option to backup task, allowing finner granularity into items included in the backup.


Sastre 0.30 [Oct 25, 2019]
==========================

Enhancements:
    - Backups now always create a new workdir. If the target workdir is already present, Sastre will save it with a
      number extension. For instance, if the target workdir is 'backup_production_20191022' and there is already a
      backup under this directory, this existing backup is moved to 'backup_production_20191022_1'. The number extension
      can go up to 99. At this point Sastre starts deleting the previous backup.

Non-backwards compatible enhancements:
    - Backup database is changed in release 0.30. Individual items (e.g. device templates, feature templates, etc) are
      now stored with a filename containing the actual item name, as opposed to the item uuid. The directories where
      items are saved were also changed.
      In order to guarantee a filesystem safe filename, item name characters other than a-z, A-Z, ' ', '-' or '_' are
      replaced with an underscore '_' in the filename. In case of name collision, Sastre falls back to using filenames
      in the format <item name>_<item id>. For instance, if there is one device template named VEDGE_1K_v1 and another
      VEDGE/1K/v1, both will have the same filename-safe name (i.e. VEDGE_1K_v1). Sastre will save them as
      VEDGE_1K_v1_<uuid item 1>.json and VEDGE_1K_v1_<uuid item 2>.json.
      The latest release using the old backup format was tagged as 'v0.2'. If there is a need to use older backups,
      just git checkout this tag (git checkout v0.2).


Sastre 0.22 [Oct 10, 2019]
==========================

Enhancements:
    - Improved error handling for malformed json files in the backup. When backup json files fail to be loaded
      (i.e. parsed) additional details are now provided in the log message.


Sastre 0.21 [Oct 5, 2019]
==========================

Enhancements:
    - Added --force option to restore task. vManage items with the same name as backup items but with differences in
      their contents are updated with data from the backup. README file contains additional details.
